## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and architect. I'm also an entrepreneur at [@Softlandia-Ltd](https://github.com/Softlandia-Ltd). Softlandia is an applied AI company helping businesses build AI-native software.

My most well-known contribution to the OSS community is the [opencv-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) project. I created it in 2016 and maintained it for about five years. In 2021, the project was adopted as an official OpenCV project under the OpenCV organization.
