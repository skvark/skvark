## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and architect. I'm also an entrepreneur at [@Softlandia-Ltd](https://github.com/Softlandia-Ltd). Softlandia is an applied AI company helping businesses build AI-native software.

My most well-known contribution to the OSS community is the [opencv-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) packaging project. I created it in 2016 and maintained it for about five years. In 2021, the project was adopted as an official OpenCV project under the OpenCV organization. The project gained over 100 million downloads during that time (now at 600+ million). It has been trusted, for example, by NASA to fly the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars.
